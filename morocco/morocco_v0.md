## Timespan of Mapping
01.01.2025 - 04.04.2025

## Username of the Mappers Involved 
1. https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Mwiche

## Were you focused on bulk or technical? 
- [x] Bulk mapping is finding towers and substations.
- [ ] Technical mapping is focused on metadata and the routing in between. 

## Mapping Environment  

- [x] [Grid Mapping Starter Kit](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/grid-mapping-starter-kit)
- [ ] Something else 

## Were the satellite images good enough in all areas for mapping? If no, in which area you were missing better data?
The satellite images were of varying qualities for different regions, so I had to combine all sources available. 

## Please provide a personal estimation of the grid quality before and after your mapping quality. What are success stories you can tell?
Before my mapping activity the grid had several gaps that needed to be filled. 

**Success Stories** 
1. Added several substations around the country, using satellite images.
2. I was able to extend lines and connect them to the grid

## In which area and in which aspects could the grid map been improved?
1. Many urban towers are still missing and lines could not be connected to substation in urban areas. 
3. The grid still has some line splits and routing issues that still needs to be fixed. 
4. For some lines voltages are still missing.
5. A lot of substations are missing meta data information 
6. There are errors in the past mapping that could be resolved.

## Mapping Strategies
Please provide the different mapping strategies you have used. 

- [x] Search for all **"Unfinished major power lines"** in Osmose and check if you are able to find new towers at the ende of the line.
- [x] Check if wind parks, solar farms, and power plants are connected to the transmission grid.
- [x] Ensure all transmission substations are connected to the grid.
- [x] Identify obvious gaps in the network topology from a national perspective.
- [x] Search for new lines parallel to existing ones and new lines starting from major central transmission substations.
- [x] Check for news reports on new substations and transmission lines that have become operational in recent years. LLMs like ChatGPT allow you to search in the local language: _"Please search for news about transmission lines or substation recently opened in country A. Please use the official language of the country for your search"_
- [x] Search for new substation records and national substation records as a reference "hint" layer. LLMs like ChatGPT allow you to search in the local language: _"Please search for transmission lines or substation datasets in X. Please use the official language of the country for your search."_ For a curated list of datasets that may be useful, see [Awesome Electric Grid Mapping](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/Awesome-Electric-Grid-Mapping). The plugin [OpenData](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/OpenData) offers you the option of using a variety of different data sets in JOSM.

## Mapping Datasets
What mapping datasets have you used as a hint layer? Please provide links to the data.

1. None
