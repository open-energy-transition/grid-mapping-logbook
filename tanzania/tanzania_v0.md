## Timespan of Mapping
01.01.2025 - 21.3.2025

## Username of the Mappers Involved 
1. https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Tobias%20Augspurger

## Were you focused on bulk or technical? 
- [x] Bulk mapping is finding towers and substations.
- [ ] Technical mapping is focused on metadata and the routing in between. 

## Mapping Environment  

- [x] [Grid Mapping Starter Kit](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/grid-mapping-starter-kit)
- [ ] Something else 

## Were the satellite images good enough in all areas for mapping? If no, in which area you were missing better data?
The satellite images were not that good for most regions, so I had to combine all sources available.

## Please provide a personal estimation of the grid quality before and after your mapping quality. What are success stories you can tell?
Before my mapping activity the grid map quality was quite mediocre. Some larger holes exist that I could fix. Now the map matches offical TSO maps in the "master plan". 

**Success Stories** 
1. One line to Zambia could be closed but this line is not connected to the larger national grid.
2. Multiple remote regions could be connected to the grid. 
3. Some power plants could be connected.
4. One line in the west could not be finished. From TSO maps this lines is still under construction and has not been closed for the regions were the satellite data was very bad. 

## In which area and in which aspects could the grid map been improved?
1. Some lines splits are not solved.
2. Multiple lines between Dodoma and the coast needs to be double checked if they are in operation. Here also not all towers and lines could be closes with current satellite data.

## Mapping Strategies
Please provide the different mapping strategies you have used. 

- [x] Search for all **"Unfinished major power lines"** in Osmose and check if you are able to find new towers at the ende of the line.
- [x] Check if wind parks, solar farms, and power plants are connected to the transmission grid.
- [x] Ensure all transmission substations are connected to the grid.
- [x] Identify obvious gaps in the network topology from a national perspective.
- [x] Search for new lines parallel to existing ones and new lines starting from major central transmission substations.
- [x] Check for news reports on new substations and transmission lines that have become operational in recent years. LLMs like ChatGPT allow you to search in the local language: _"Please search for news about transmission lines or substation recently opened in country A. Please use the official language of the country for your search"_
- [x] Search for new substation records and national substation records as a reference "hint" layer. LLMs like ChatGPT allow you to search in the local language: _"Please search for transmission lines or substation datasets in X. Please use the official language of the country for your search."_ For a curated list of datasets that may be useful, see [Awesome Electric Grid Mapping](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/Awesome-Electric-Grid-Mapping). The plugin [OpenData](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/OpenData) offers you the option of using a variety of different data sets in JOSM.

## Mapping Datasets
What mapping datasets have you used as a hint layer? Please provide links to the data.
